# Lab 2: Shell Scripting
Bash scripts have a .sh extension. After editing a script in an editor, run `chmod +x <script_name>.sh` to give the required
permissions.
We will learn shell scripting through various examples. The scripts are present in the scripts folder for each of the examples.
1. Echo Your name.
2. Print the sum of two numbers passed as arguments.
3. Bubble sort
4. Create a directory called "try". Go into it and create some empty files using touch. Now, write a script to extend the name
of all files in try directory with filename.try. For example, file named xyz becomes xyz.try.

## Lab Assignment
1. Display the result after multiplying two numbers passed as arguments. If number of arguments are not proper, print error
message.
2. In script 4, suppose there are some folders in your directory as well. Now, write a script such that only files are extended
to a .try extension.
3. Print all fibonacci numbers that are <=100.
4. Sort the numbers passed as command line arguments in ascending order using selection sort.
